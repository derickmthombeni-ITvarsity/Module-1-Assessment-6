        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>This is a general use face mask. This mask is neither a medical device, nor personal protective equipment. It is not intended for use in healthcare settings and it is not proven to reduce the transmission of disease.
            Each AirPop Light SE mask when properly cleaned will continue performing at up to 98% efficiency. To achieve this all masks should be cleaned with 70% alcohol or soap and water, and dried naturally for up to 24 hours.
            The Airpop Light SE mask is in a pack of 4. Our masks are designed to ft a variety of facial sizes and feature soft, adjustable elastic ear-loops for maximum comfort and security.
            The Airpop face covering is made from 4 layers of ultra durable non-woven materials. The outer layer is fluid resistant while the double thickness interior melt-blown layer is electrostatically charged for maximum efficiency. The soft inner layer helps to absorb moisture and is comfortable against the skin.
            The Airpop Light SE washable face masks features a patented soft touch silicone seal, specifically contoured to fit your nose bridge, ensuring a soft yet secure fit that helps reduce fogging for people who wear glasses.</p>
